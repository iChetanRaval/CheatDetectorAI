# CheatDetectAI

CheatDetectAI is a machine learning-based project for anomaly detection during online activities. It leverages advanced techniques like facial landmark detection and object recognition for effective analysis.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following files that are too large for GitHub:

1. **Shape Predictor 68 Face Landmarks**  
   [Download here from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergiovirahonda/shape-predictor-68-face-landmarksdat)

2. **YOLOv3 Weights**  
   [Download here from official YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

Once downloaded, place these files in the appropriate directories as follows:
- `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` → `models/`
- `yolov3.weights` → `weights/`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iChetanRaval/CheatDetectorAI.git
